This file contains a comparisons between using temptables, result sets, and ORMS.

1. There is no way to easily sort result sets easily. Using Collections' sort functionality is fine but a conversion from a result set to an object is still necessary. This entails doing some sort of ad-hoc object-relational mapping as well as writing a sort function. Though it is trivial, it is still tedious.

2. There are no way to do joins on result sets. A nested for loop can do a pseudo-join but it will take much longer and is much more inefficient than using ABL's temp-table joins.

3. Query functionality like ABL's ACCUMULATE or SQL's GROUP BY is not available to result sets. Code needs to be written to create this functionality for result sets, increasing redundancy.
